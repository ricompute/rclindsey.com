abstract = "Thyroid hormone (TH) is an established regulator of skeletal growth and maintenance both in clinical studies and in laboratory models. The clinical consequences of altered thyroid status on the skeleton during development and in adulthood are well known, and genetic mouse models in which elements of the TH signaling axis have been manipulated illuminate the mechanisms which underlie TH regulation of the skeleton. TH is involved in the regulation of the balance between proliferation and differentiation in several skeletal cell types including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. The effects of TH are mediated primarily via the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) α and β, ligand-inducible nuclear receptors which act as transcription factors to regulate target gene expression. Both TRα and TRβ signaling are important for different stages of skeletal development. The molecular mechanisms of TH action in bone are complex and include interaction with a number of growth factor signaling pathways. This review provides an overview of the regulation and mechanisms of TH action in bone, focusing particularly on the role of TH in endochondral bone formation during postnatal growth."
