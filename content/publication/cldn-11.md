abstract: The claudin (Cldn) family comprises 27 members of 20-34 kDa 
  transmembrane tight junction proteins. In addition to their established
  canonical role as barriers controlling paracellular flow of molecules, a
  distinct non-canonical role for Cldns as mediators of cell signaling is now
  emerging. In our studies evaluating Cldn family expression levels during
  osteoblast differentiation, *Cldn-11* showed the largest increase (60-fold).
  Immunohistochemistry studies revealed high Cldn-11 expression in trabecular
  (Tb) bone lining cells. MicroCT analysis of femurs, tibiae, and vertebrae of
  Cldn-11 knockout (KO) mice at 12 weeks of age exhibited a 40% (*P* < 0.01)
  reduction in Tb bone volume adjusted for tissue volume compared to control
  mice, a change caused by significant reductions in Tb number and thickness and
  increase in Tb separation. Histomorphometry and serum biomarker studies
  revealed that reduced bone formation, not increased resorption, is the cause
  for reduced Tb bone volume in the Cldn-11 KO mice. Cldn-11 KO osteoblasts
  expressed reduced *ALP* and *BSP* while *Cldn-11* overexpression in MC3T3-E1 cells
  increased expression of *ALP* and *BSP*. Mechanistically, Cldn-11 interacted with
  tetraspanin (Tspan)3 in osteoblasts, and *Tspan3* knockdown reduced osteoblast
  differentiation. Since members of the Tspan family regulate cell functions via
  Notch signaling, we evaluated whether Cldn-11/Tspan3 regulates Notch signaling
  in osteoblasts. Accordingly, Notch targets *Hey1* and *Hey2* were significantly
  upregulated in *Cldn-11* overexpressing cultures but downregulated in both
  *Cldn-11* KO and *Tspan3* knockdown osteoblasts. Since ADAM10 has been shown to
  interact with Tspan family members to regulate Notch signaling, we evaluated
  whether Cldn-11 regulates ADAM10 expression. Cldn-11 overexpressing cells
  express more mature ADAM10, and an ADAM10 inhibitor blocked the Cldn-11 effect
  on osteoblast differentiation. Based on these data, we propose Cldn-11 as a
  novel component of a osteoblast cell surface protein complex, comprising
  Tspan3 and ADAM10, which regulates Notch signaling and cell differentiation.
