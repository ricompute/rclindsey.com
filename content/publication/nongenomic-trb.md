abstract: Thyroid hormone (TH) levels increase rapidly during the prepubertal 
  growth period in mice, and this change is necessary for endochondral
  ossification of the epiphyses. This effect of TH on epiphyseal chondrocyte
  hypertrophy is mediated via TRβ1. In addition to its traditional genomic
  signaling role as a transcription factor, TRβ1 can also exert nongenomic
  effects by interacting with other signaling molecules such as PI3K. To
  investigate the role of nongenomic TRβ1 signaling in endochondral
  ossification, we evaluated the skeletal phenotype of TRβ147F mutant mice which
  exhibit a normal genomic response of TRβ1 to TH, but the nongenomic response
  through the PI3K pathway is impaired. Using microCT, we found that 13-week-old
  TRβ147F mice had significantly less trabecular bone mass at three sites.
  Histomorphometric analyses revealed that mineralizing surface to bone surface
  and BFR/BS were reduced in the mutant mice. Mechanistically, we found that
  activation of TRβ increased Alp and Osx expression in control but not TRβ147F
  osteoblasts. Since canonical β-catenin signaling has been implicated in
  mediating nongenomic TRβ-PI3K signaling, we evaluated the effect of TRβ1
  activation on β-catenin target gene expression in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. We
  found that β-catenin target genes were increased, suggesting that nongenomic
  TRβ1-PI3K pathway modulation of β-catenin signaling may mediate TRβ1 effects
  on osteoblast differentiation. Together, these results suggest that TH acting
  through TRβ1 regulates endochondral ossification in part via nongenomic
  signaling in mice. Further investigation of this nongenomic mechanism of TRβ1
  signaling could lead to novel therapeutic targets for treatment and prevention
  of osteoporosis.
